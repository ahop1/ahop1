- 👋 Hi, I’m @ahop1
- 👀 I’m interested in problem solving and building interesting tools, in whatever language is best for the job.
- 🌱 I’m most experienced in SQL and Python (standard analytics-related libraries, plus creating desktop apps using PyQt4 and pyinstaller, and some web development with Django), but have also done a bit with HTML, CSS, Javascript and more recently React.js and d3.js also.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting problems that can be solved/automated with software.
